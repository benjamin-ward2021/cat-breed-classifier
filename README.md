This project attempts to classify the breed of a cat based on their vocalization. The data is from "CatMeows: A Publicly-Available Dataset of Cat Vocalizations" which contains 440 recordings of 2 different breeds of cats. I take that data and use a script in Praat to create a CSV file containing information on the pitch of each of the recordings. I then train a random forest classifier on that data and attempt to correctly identify the breed of the cat.
